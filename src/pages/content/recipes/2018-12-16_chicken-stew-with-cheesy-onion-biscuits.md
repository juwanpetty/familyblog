    Preheat the oven to 425°F (to bake biscuits ).


    Wash and dry all produce.* Thinly slice the green onions. In a large bowl,
    whisk together 11/4 cup flour, baking powder, 3 tbsp water, 1 tsp sugar and
    1/2 tsp salt. Add mayo, cheese, half the green onions and half the sour
    cream. Stir together. Using your hands, mix the dough until it forms into a
    ball and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Flatten dough and press into
    a 1-inch thick round disc. Set aside.

    Meanwhile, strip 1 tbsp thyme leaves from the stems. Mince or grate the
    garlic. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch
    cubes.

    Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1
    tbsp oil, then the chicken. Cook until golden-brown, 6-8 min. (TIP: Cook to
    a min. internal temp. of 74°C/165°F, as size may vary.**) Season with salt
    and pepper. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Reduce heat to medium. Add 2
    tbsp butter to the pan, then the mirepoix, leeks, garlic and thyme. Cook,
    stirring occasionally, until the mirepoix softens slightly, 3-4 min.

    Return the chicken to the pan and pour over any remaining juices from the
    plate. Sprinkle the remaining flour over the chicken and veggies. Stir for 1
    min. Stir in the broth concentrates, 2 1/2 cups water and remaining sour
    cream. Cook until the sauce thickens slightly, 8-9 min. Season with salt and
    pepper.

    Cut the biscuit disc into four quarters, then cut each quarter in half.
    (NOTE: You will have 8 pieces in total.) Transfer the biscuits to a
    parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake in the middle of the oven until the
    biscuits are puffed up and golden-brown, 10-12 min.
  - >-
    Divide the chicken stew between bowls. Sprinkle over the remaining green
    onions. Serve with the cheesy onion biscuits.
