  - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper for heat
  - 1 teaspoon salt

    Red Pepper Butter: Pulse all the butter ingredients in a food process until
    mostly smooth. Refrigerate or set aside. (You’ll have A LOT of butter and
    you’ll only need a few tablespoons for this recipe. Keep the extras in the
    freezer for more of this, or similar recipes, in the future!)

    Fettuccine: Cook the fettuccine according to package directions. Add pasta
    back to warm pot and toss with 2-3 tablespoons red pepper garlic butter,
    cream, and water. Adding reserved water as needed to thin out the sauce.
  - >-
    Shrimp: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the red pepper
    garlic butter. Once the butter is melted, add shrimp and saute for a few
    minutes on each side until cooked through. To make it look creamy, add 1-2
    tablespoons of the red pepper butter with a quick splash of cream to the hot
    pan and toss to combine.
  - 'Serve: Divide the pasta and shrimp among 3-4 plates. Enjoy!'
