  Silky smooth noodles coated in just the right amount of luxurious sauce,
  speckled with garlic-buttery pan-roasted mushrooms. Oh yes we did. Bring it
  in. Group hug.
ingredients:
  - '1/2 cup Land O Lakes® Butter, divided'
  - '2 cloves fresh garlic, or a pinch of garlic salt'
  - 16 ounces fresh sliced mushrooms (more if you love mushrooms!)
  - 1 cup heavy whipping cream
  - 1 pound fettuccine
  - 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
  - 1 cup reserved pasta water
  - 1 teaspoon salt (more to taste)
  - Fresh ground black pepper
  - Parsley for topping
steps:
  - >-
    Clean the mushrooms. Add the garlic and mushrooms to a large skillet with 2
    tablespoons of the butter. Sauté until the mushrooms are soft with deep
    brown color – 10-15 minutes. Add the cream and the rest of the butter.
    Simmer over low heat.

    Cook the fettuccine in a large pot according to package directions. Drain,
    reserving a little bit of the water, and return to pan.
  - >-
    Add mushroom sauce to the hot fettuccine in the pan. Toss with tongs to mix.
    Add Parmesan and up to 1 cup of reserved pasta water as needed to get the
    consistency right. Season with salt and pepper. And now stand at the stove
    and eat it straight out the pan. So good.
